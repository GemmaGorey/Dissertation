# Goal 1: Computational Capability Assessment

This document summarizes the performance of the local and cloud platforms.

### Platform Specifications
* **Local:** MacBook Air/Pro (CPU)
* **Cloud:** Google Colab (NVIDIA T4 GPU)

### Benchmark Results

| Task                      | Local Mac (CPU) Time | Colab (GPU) Time |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Audio Processing (Librosa)| ~22.18s              | ~15.94s          |
| Audio Processing (Torchaudio)| ~0.05s               | ~0.76s           |
| CNN Training (10 epochs)  | 2.92s                | 1.20s            |


"Based on the benchmark results, model training is significantly faster on the Colab GPU. Therefore, the chosen workflow will be hybrid: code development and small-scale data tasks will be performed locally, while all model training and evaluation will be performed on Google Colab to leverage GPU acceleration."
